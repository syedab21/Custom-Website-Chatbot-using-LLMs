# Custom-Website-Chatbot-using-LLMs

🤖 The website chatbot utilizes an embedding model to convert unstructured website data 📄 into vector format and stores it in a vector database such as Pinecone 🧠. When a user asks a question ❓ about the website, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant information from the vector store and passes it to the LLM (Large Language Model) for accurate and context-aware responses ✅.
